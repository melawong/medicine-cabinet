## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to play around.


## What's inside? 
- A simple medicine cabinet that shows available prescriptions, from which you can save your favorites!
- A search bar to find specific medicines.
- A hub of all your saved favorites.
- A cute little loading animation, just because. (With 2 second delay just so you get to see it in action!)
